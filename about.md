## Some stuff I wrote about myself.

I am a public interest technologist. I try my best to build data-driven systems that serve our communities and to think about how to mitigate and avoid the harms that can inadvertently stem from such systems.

Originally trained as a digital humanist, I enjoy applying a computational lens to humanist questions and a humanist lens to computational questions. 

Currently, I work as a data scientist at the T, where I build models and visualizations to support the operations of America's fourth largest transit system.
