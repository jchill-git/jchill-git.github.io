        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h2>Some stuff I wrote about myself</h2>
        <p>I am a public interest technologist. I try my best to build data-driven systems that serve our communities and to think about how to mitigate and avoid the harms that can inadvertently stem from such systems.</p>
        <p>Originally trained as a digital humanist, I enjoy applying a computational lens to humanist questions and a humanist lens to computational questions.</p>
        <p>Currently, I work as a data scientist at the T, where I build models and visualizations to support the operations of America’s fourth largest transit system.</p>
        <p>This website is a place for me to share my personal projects and thoughts and does not express the views or opinions of my employer.</p>
