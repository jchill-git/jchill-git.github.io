Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Abd Allah Sadi’s _Tarikh As-Sudan_ is an important Arabic history of West Africa. Written in the 1650s in Timbuktu it serves, along with _Tarikh Al-Fattash_, as the core primary source for the history of the Songhai Empire. Section in the middle of the work, spanning multiple chapters, is dedicated to describing the scholars of Timbuktu and Djenne. This project consisted of two parts. The first was the production of an aligned, open-source English translation of the 9th chapter of the chroncle. The second was network analysis of the descriptors Sadi applies to the scholars he describes across the 6th, 9th, and 10th chapters.
