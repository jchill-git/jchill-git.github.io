The goal of this project was to follow [Sinclair and Rockwell's hermenuetic spiral](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262545891/hermeneutica/) approach to text analysis. My project partners and I created a corpus of reader comments about the Harry Potter series using the since discontinued GoodReads API (RIP) and then explored it using a combination of Voyant and various python scripts. 

The final project is hosted as a [Google Site](https://sites.google.com/view/gk-jh-finalproject/home).
If you want to use our corpus for any reason that's available on my GitHub: [HP Comments](https://github.com/jchill-git/HP-comments).

## Challenges & Learnings
This may have been the first project where I really used Python. It was definitely the first web scraper I ever built. A lot of the code we used for topic modeling and clustering was adapted sample code from [Fernando Nascimento's](https://www.bowdoin.edu/profiles/faculty/fnascime/index.html) digital text analysis class and our findings weren't terribly robust, but this project definitely started me on my journey into DH.
