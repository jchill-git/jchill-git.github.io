This work came very directly out of my previous effort to produce an enriched digital edition of the [Autobiography Omar ibn Said](/projects/omaribnsaid/). During that project, I'd come to the realization that a number of key tool advances in the previous couple of years meant we were very close to being able to automate the production of all of the annotations I had painstakingly produced. But at the time, no one had strung them all together into a single pipeline. The motivation was the massive online repositories of digital Arabic generated by the OpenITI and KITAB projects. Those collections could absolutely serve as the backbone of a huge expansion of the Perseus Project into Arabic sources, but they were too large for the kind of annotations we wanted to support to be manually produced.

I presented a poster on this project at the Tufts Graduate Student Symposium. You can check that out [here](/assets/documents/Grad Student Research Symposium_ Poster_Joe Hilleary_updated.pdf).

## Topics
- Digital Humanities
- Digital Libraries
- Arabic NLP

## Technologies Used
- Kraken
- ArSummarizer
- CAMeL Tools
- CamelParser
- Stanza

## Challenges & Learnings
My big realization from this project was that there still wasn't a good model for the translation alignment task, which in turn inspired some of my thesis work.
