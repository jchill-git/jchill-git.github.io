Over the course of nine months I interviewed upwards of 40 faculty and staff across the university, trying to establish a picture of what "data science" (that slipperiest of terms) looked like at Tufts. My report, which you can find [here](/assets/documents/The State of Data Science at Tufts University.pdf) outlined both the current state of data science ecosystem and synthesized recommendations from the interviewees about how it could be improved.
